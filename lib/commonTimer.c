 *      Collection of ways of initializing timer 2 for counting, pass F_CPU for speed setting
 *      based on compile time define for speed. This scales the counters for 8 MHz to 16 Mhz.

 *      Version Status: 0.3
 *      Feb, 11 2014	0.3	changed timers to be scalable by speed and added timer 0 1 ms
 *      11/5/14		0.1	setup first 100us counter
 *
 *      2019 modified by Hugo Schaaf v0.4
 *      - adapt isr vectors in correlation with the user's timer choice
